DEX AI: Pokémon Website Chatbot Requirements
I. Functional Requirements
DEX AI must be able to perform the following core functions:

Pokémon Information Retrieval:

Pokedex Entries: Provide official Pokedex entries for any given Pokémon, including species, type(s), abilities, height, weight, and base stats.
Evolution Lines: Detail a Pokémon's evolutionary stages, including methods of evolution (e.g., level up, trade, item, friendship).
Movepools: List moves a Pokémon can learn, specifying by what method (e.g., level-up, TM/HM, egg move, tutor).
Type Effectiveness: Explain the effectiveness of one Pokémon type against another (e.g., "What is effective against Grass?").
Location: Provide information on where a specific Pokémon can be found in various games (e.g., "Where can I find Pikachu in Scarlet and Violet?").
Item Information Retrieval:

Item Description: Provide a description and purpose of any in-game item (e.g., berries, evolution stones, held items, TMs).
Location/Acquisition: Indicate where an item can be found or how it can be acquired.
Ability Information Retrieval:

Ability Description: Explain the effect of a given Pokémon ability.
Pokémon with Ability: List Pokémon that possess a specific ability.
Move Information Retrieval:

Move Description: Detail the effect, power, accuracy, PP, and category (Physical, Special, Status) of a given move.
Pokémon Learning Move: List Pokémon that can learn a specific move.
Trainer/NPC Information (Optional but highly recommended):

Key Trainer Details: Provide basic information about important in-game trainers (e.g., Gym Leaders, Elite Four, Champions), including their team composition (if applicable and widely known).
Game-Specific Information:

Version Specificity: Allow users to specify a game version (e.g., "Pikachu's moveset in Pokémon Red," "Where to find Feebas in Pokémon Emerald").
Region Information: Provide details about specific regions (e.g., "Tell me about the Galar region").
Team Building & Strategy (Basic):

Type Coverage Suggestions: Offer basic advice on type coverage for a given team.
Counter Suggestions: Suggest Pokémon that are effective against a given Pokémon or type.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU):

Intent Recognition: Accurately identify the user's intent from various phrasings (e.g., "What's Charizard's best ability?", "Charizard abilities," "Tell me about Charizard's powers").
Entity Extraction: Extract key entities like Pokémon names, move names, item names, game versions, and types from user queries.
Conversation Management:

Contextual Understanding: Maintain context within a conversation (e.g., if a user asks "What about its evolution?" after discussing a Pokémon, DEX AI should understand "its" refers to the previously mentioned Pokémon).
Clarification: Ask clarifying questions if a user's query is ambiguous.
Greeting & Farewell: Initiate and conclude conversations politely.
Fallback Responses: Provide helpful and polite fallback responses when unable to fulfill a request.
Data Integration:

PokéAPI Integration: Integrate with a reliable Pokémon API (e.g., PokeAPI) to fetch up-to-date and comprehensive Pokémon data.
Website Content Integration: Potentially link to relevant pages on the website for more in-depth information.
II. Non-Functional Requirements
These requirements define the quality attributes and constraints of DEX AI:

Performance:

Response Time: Respond to user queries within 2-3 seconds for common requests.
Scalability: Be able to handle a large number of concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.
Reliability:

Accuracy: Provide accurate and consistent information based on official Pokémon data.
Availability: Be available 24/7 with minimal downtime.
Error Handling: Gracefully handle API errors, invalid inputs, and unexpected situations.
Usability:

User-Friendly Interface: Integrate seamlessly into the website's chat interface.
Clear and Concise Responses: Provide information in an easy-to-understand and well-formatted manner.
Accessibility: Adhere to web accessibility guidelines (e.g., for users with disabilities).
Security:

Data Privacy: Protect user data and ensure no sensitive information is collected or stored unnecessarily.
API Key Management: Securely manage API keys for external services.
Maintainability:

Modularity: Designed with a modular architecture to allow for easy updates and additions of new features.
Documentation: Well-documented code and API usage for future development and maintenance.
Data Update Mechanism: A clear process for updating the underlying Pokémon data as new games or updates are released.
Extensibility:

New Features: Easy to extend with new features in the future (e.g., competitive battling advice, specific game walkthroughs).
Language Support: Potential for future expansion to support multiple languages.
Ethics & Safety:

No Harmful Content: Ensure the chatbot does not generate or propagate harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content.
Neutrality: Maintain a neutral and objective tone.
III. Technical Considerations
Platform/Framework: Choice of AI framework (e.g., Rasa, Google Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, custom Python/Node.js solution).
Database: A database to store custom data or cache API responses for faster retrieval.
Deployment Environment: Cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premise.
Version Control: Git for source code management.
By addressing these requirements, DEX AI will be a valuable and engaging addition to any Pokémon website, providing users with instant access to a wealth of Pokémon knowledge.
